# Overview

This program simulates a particle's non-relativistic motion in dipole magnetic field.

Three different options are available for numerical integration: [Euler-Cromer](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.12478), [Boris](https://books.google.com/books?id=S2lqgDTm6a4C&q=Borris#v=onepage&q=Boris&f=false), and [Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19700031412/downloads/19700031412.pdf).

Euler-Cromer integration is faster, but less accurate than both Boris and RKF.

`rk45` takes longer for similar accuracy, except when adaptive time step is especially useful such as at high latitudes.

The Boris method can be computed to an arbitrary time step, usually shorter for similar accuracy. Inaccurate near small pitch angles (< 5Â°) (more than Runga Kutta) due to no adaptive steps. 

For equatorial-bound particles, the time step needed for the Boris method is quite low at `0.01` in nd time steps otherwise lower timesteps are generally needed. The Boris integration option in this code also has an option to only simulate one drift period in order to shorten computation time. 

The Boris method is tailored specifically to Lorentz force motion, as it conserves system's energy better. Boris method in general can handle electric fields, but this has not been implemented.

Initial condition and properties are measured in a more convenient centered dipole coordinate system while the integration is performed in non-dimensional cartesian coordinates.

# Examples

## Comparison of RK45 and Borris

## Proton; L= ..., E = ..., \alpha = ...

By default, generates trajectory of electrons, proton, and alpha particles at a few varying pitch angles. Note that electrons are particularly compute intensive due to the high charge to mass ratio
with _2dplots = True, generates 3 plots: error vs time, cartesian coordinates vs time, and x vs y
more plots can be enabled by uncommenting them in plots.py

Exports particle path trajectories as .VTKs for import into Paraview for viewing.
